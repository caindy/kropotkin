Kropotkin is a framework that expressly encourages the practise of Continuous
Rewriting. It does this by making it easy (and in fact mandatory) to create
your application from a large number of very loosely coupled, miniscule
components, which co-operate via a shared factspace containing immutable facts
about the business domain.

Kropotkin is written in Python but explicitly encourages polyglot programming.
Components can and should be written in a wide variety of programming
languages.

To get started, just ensure Python is installed, run bootstrap.py, and follow
the instructions. You may need to upgrade Python and you will definitely need
to install one Python module - but nothing else is required.
